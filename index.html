      <h3>Design</h3>

      <div class="card-content" style="display:none;">

        <p>I often found myself being the one to handle graphic design whenever it was needed in different activities. Over time, that helped me grow my skills—and honestly, it made me fall in love with design ♪ྀི.</p>

      <h3>Programming</h3>

      <div class="card-content" style="display:none;">

        <p>I got into programming out of curiosity in 10th grade. I started with C++ courses on YouTube and learned the basics. I also explored some Python using the Mimo app.I programmed and designed a robot control application using appinventor. I am also learning some basics of html, css and js by programming this website. I enjoy writing code and solving problems, and I can't wait to continue my programming journey at university!</p>

      <h3>Volunteering</h3>

      <div class="card-content" style="display:none;">
<p>For me, growth means volunteering. Some of the best moments in my life happened while doing volunteer work—especially the Yumn Initiative, which was the first volunteering project where I had a regular and meaningful role.</p>

      <h3>My ultimate goal is to leave a positive impact </h3>

      <div class="card-content" style="display:none;">

        <p>Since I was a child, I've always wondered: Why am I here? What is my role? And how can a person be forgotten after his death? So, I made it my goal to leave a positive impact, not just be a passing facilitator, but to leave a legacy that those who come after me will remember me by.</p>

        <p>My wanderlust and boundless curiosity fuel my desire to know everything around me and see the whole world☆°</p>

      <h3>To see peace prevail throughout the world. </h3>

      <div class="card-content" style="display:none;">

        <p>Most of all, I wish I could see a world where no child cries because they don't feel safe, no man is sad because he can't take care of his family, and no woman is treated badly just for being a woman and is afraid of what people think. I hope wars will end and there will be peace everywhere.</p>

      <h3>Earn degrees in multiple fields ཻུ۪۪♡</h3>

      <div class="card-content" style="display:none;">

        <p>Ever since I was little, I hated the idea of being stuck on just one path, or doing what everyone else does – studying one thing and then just working in that area. I've always wanted to try everything I can! That's why I'm aiming to get degrees in a bunch of different fields "Especially pharmacy, programming and psychology" because they are the branches that most suit my interests!♡°</p>

      <h3>Friends</h3>

      <div class="card-content" style="display:none;">

        <p>I love the time I spend with my friends. We don’t need anything fancy to have fun — just being together is enough - we laugh, play, and make a mess out of everything.

We create memories that stay with us forever. 
We help each other, study together, and make even the hardest days feel easier. 
Every moment with them makes me feel safeྀི</p>

        <p>Aleppo♡ is not just a city, but it is the place where I took my first breath, my memories, my joys, my sorrows, my successes, the place where I belong and feel that it is a part of me and I am a part of it.</p>
